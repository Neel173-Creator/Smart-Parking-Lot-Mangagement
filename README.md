# Smart-Parking-Lot-Mangagement

### 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a **Smart Parking Lot Management system** using **C++**.  
It allows you to manage parking in a lot with a fixed capacity by tracking parked cars using a **linked list** data structure.  
The program supports dynamic parking and exit of cars while preventing overflow when the lot is full.
